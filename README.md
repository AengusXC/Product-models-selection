# Product Models Selection based on Portfolio Optimization
Graduation project of product models selection from both the engineering and financing perspectives. The selection process is achieved from a total portfolio perspective by optimizing the portfolio based on Mean-Variance analysis. A mathematical model of the problem is constructed via introducing and integrating the adjusted MPT in the financial field, along with AHP and similarity analysis method in engineering field. At the end, Monte Carlo and Gradient Descent method are implemented and compared in finding the optimal portfolio.

The raw data file is CarPrice.csv, where information like different car models with different features can be obtained. The final result is given in the Result file, where 100 trails' results are generated by using Monte Carlo simulation, along with a the result found by Gradient Descent method.
