# Product Models Selection based on Portfolio Optimization
Graduation project of product models selection from both the engineering and financing perspectives. The selection process is achieved from a total portfolio perspective by optimizing the portfolio based on Mean-Variance analysis. A mathematical model of the problem is constructed via introducing and integrating the adjusted MPT in the financial field, along with AHP and similarity analysis method in engineering field. At the end, Monte Carlo and Gradient Descent methods are implemented and compared in finding the optimal portfolio.
